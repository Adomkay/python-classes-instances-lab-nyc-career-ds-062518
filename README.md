# Practice With Classes and Instances

## Introduction
Okay, we learned how to delcare classes and create instances in our last lesson. Let's put these new skills to the test!

## Objectives

* Practice defining classes
* Practice instantiating instances of classes

## Defining Classes


Let's define a `Ride`, `Driver`, and `Passenger` class as these are all crucial parts to a single ride.

> **Reminder:** *since we need to have some Python code in our class to define it, we can simply write the keyword `pass` on the first line under our class definition*


```python
# define class for Ride
```


```python
# define class for Driver
```


```python
# define class for Passenger
```

## Creating Instances

Let's now practice using our classes to make instances of those classes. Let's make two instances of the Passenger class and assign them to the variables `meryl` and `daniel`, respectively.


```python
meryl = None
daniel = None
```

Next, make one instance of the driver class and assign it to the variable, `flatiron_taxi`.


```python
flatiron_taxi = None
```

Finally, make two instances of the Ride class and assign them to `ride_to_school` and `ride_home`. 


```python
ride_to_school = None
ride_home = None
```

## Summary
Great! In this lab, we were able to define multiple classes and create instances of those classes.
